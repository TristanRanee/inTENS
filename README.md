# inTENS
Repository for the novel TENS machine device design, report and market analysis.


inTENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) is a device focused on providing pain relief on the go. There is a growing demographic of people today who face muscle or nerve pain such as those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as arthritis), athletes (who repetitively stress their body by performing strenuous physical activity) and labourers and other people who experience muscle pain from their lifestyle or occupation where they may undertake work that can lead to muscle pain. There are a variety of types and areas of pain one can experience, and due to this, all TENS users will use the device differently - be it area of stimulation, or stimulation settings.

In saying this, TENS machines are required to be as functionally flexible as possible in order to accomodate for all users. Since the main use of this machine is primarily associated with pain relief while moving or performing day-to-day tasks, particularly in public, there is the need for a TENS device that is seamless, intuitive to use but most importantly concealable. The majority of current TENS products designed for this use case are not wireless and are quite large. Furthermore, few products provide the benefits of a mobile user interface and stimulation customization. Among these products, none are designed to be clothing integratable and concealable for public usage. 

Thus, in this report an optimised solution for this specific usage is proposed; a TENS device that is miniature, wireless and clothing integratable. Additionally, a detailed market analysis is conducted to gain a better understanding of the current state of the market and what features need to be implemented to create a competitive product. This is paired with a business plan to glimpse at the financial performance and profitability of this product. Lastly, a development plan is established to effectively utilise time and resources while identifying and preparing for risk in order to ensure project completion.
